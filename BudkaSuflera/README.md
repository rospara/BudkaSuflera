# Project BudkaSuflera

This is attempt to solve the task called "Budka Suflera" from SPOJ portal
https://pl.spoj.com/problems/MWP8_1B. The goal is to reduce execution time on spoj to 1.5s.


## Usage

Just attach the code of Program as solution on the page above.

## Ideas to optimize the solution:

1. No sorting of result collection - inserting element on its place during filling in the collection.
2. Parallel processing - for example parrarel loop - dividing words of song collection on pieces
3. Guess how long are inputs collections on spoj - allocate list/array that max length
4. custom comperer case that do not replace the same elements and compare first first char and lenth
